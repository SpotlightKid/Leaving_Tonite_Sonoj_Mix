# Leaving Tonite Lyrics

Something  in the air tonight  
Something, baby, outta sight  
Something I can't read in your eyes  
Something, baby, behind the lies

Mama always said: "be nice!"  
My friends say: "Listen to my advice!"  
Sometimes I don't know anymore what's wrong or what's right  
Oh tell my, baby, are you leaving tonite?

Give me a sign, oh baby!  
We'll be allright, if you stay tonight!  

Give me a sign, oh baby!  
We'll see the light, come stay tonight!  
We'll be allright, oh baby!  
Dance into the light and stay tonight!
